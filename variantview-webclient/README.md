This is the frontend/webclient portion of the I2B2 Variantview plugin
The first time this repo is cloned, the `initial_setup.sh` file must be run.
That script takes care of some housekeeping, and does not need to be rerun
unless the frontend is being installed on a machine/VM that it has never
been installed on before.
